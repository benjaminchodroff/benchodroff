I am a passionate technologist who enjoys solving real world problems with creative people. When I am not at work, you can likely find me traveling and photographing the world.

I started this blog because I am constantly finding new ideas on the internet and I wanted to give a little back. No bias, no positions. If anything here ever helps you or you have a question, [I would love to hear from you](http://www.benchodroff.com/contact/).
